# Development-of-mini-Swarm-Drones-
Swarm drones are multiple unmanned aerial flying platforms integrated as a single networked system self-contained for communication, reconnaissance, and weapons to strike an enemy target, etc.
The technology is being explored throughout the world in many areas for various applications. These include defense systems to provide security to the people, stage entertainment, spot spraying during fire outbreaks, hunting thieves wifi coverage and so on.
The drone swarm concept has been taken from natural flocking behavior found in birds, animals and insects. 
Two major categories of drone swarm system
 Manual drone swarm. 
Automatic drone Swarm.
